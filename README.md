## Project Description
This analysis project takes a deep dive into Movie Dataset to uncover interesting trends and insights. We used datasets from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) provided free from TMDB API, with this dataset we do analysis to get a comprehensive understanding of the movie industry. 

Before starting the analysis, we have to clean and transform the existing movies dataset consisting of 3 tables and hundreds of thousand of rows so that it becomes a clean and fit data for analysis. This transformation stage can be seen on [here in kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aslambryantama/data-cleaning-transformation-movies-dataset).

The datasets include information such as movie titles, release dates, budgets, box-office results, ratings, genres, and many more. We mainly used **descriptive** analysis to explore patterns and answer questions about the movie industry. Some of the questions we sought to answer include : 
1. How many number of films produced each year? is there any progress?
2. Is There any Correlation Beetween Budget and Revenue?
3. What are Word that Appear the most on Movies Title
4. What is the usual runtime for every movies
5. What are the most popular genre in each generation
6. What are the Best and the Worst Movie based on it's performance
7. Are Franchise Movies more Successfull? Which are the most successfull Franchise?
8. Who is the Most Active and Successfull Director?
10. Who is the Most Active and Successful Actor?
11. Which Production Companies is the most Successfull?

We used various data visualization techniques to illustrate the insights we uncovered. Our findings demonstrate a strong correlation between budget, release date, and box-office results, and reveal some of the most popular genres and ratings.
